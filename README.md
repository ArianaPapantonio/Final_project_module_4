# 🌈 Final Project Module 4 - Proud Travelers 

This project was developed by **Marta Gamarra**, **Marina Gascó**, **Ariana Papantonio**, and **Verónica Sánchez** as part of **Module 4: Data Visualization | Power BI & Tableau** in the **Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp**.

Our goal was to explore and clean data, strength our **ETL** and **data visualization** skills and create impactful visualizations with **Tableau** or **Power BI** to communicate insights effectively.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Proud Travelers** is a data-driven project designed to help LGTBIQA+ individuals explore the world more safely and informed.  
Our aim was to visualize the current state of LGTBIQA+ legal protections, safety levels, and social trends around the globe — in a clear, accessible way.

We combined data cleaning and analysis with engaging visualizations to create an informative and interactive experience.
